Thanks for reading my blogs and rants, its been a great day, its the day after christmas after all, ho ho ho! Anyways, watch some anime, do some rants, here is the TL;DR of what I like.

- Anime (Mostly stuff like Apothocary Diaries, How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom, etc)
- Gaming
- Programming (Low level OS stuff)
