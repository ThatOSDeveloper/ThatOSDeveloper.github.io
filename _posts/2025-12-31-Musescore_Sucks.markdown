Many of the musically inclined very well know the app called musescore, its amazing, but I hate it because you have to PAY TO GET THE MUSIC THAT YOU CAN READ FOR FREE! Like WHATS THE LOGIC? I CAN JUST SCREENSHOT IT THEN PRINT OUT THE SCREENSHOT! Anyways you get my point, its just a horrible, useless tool that only helps you I dunno, learn how to pirate their songs.
